Method:

Sequenced reads were mapped to the reference transcript sequences to compute the transcript abundance.
In this process, the Computational Cancer Analysis Library (CCAL), which uses 'Kallisto', and GRCh38 reference transcript sequences from Ensembl were used.
The expression value for a gene was then set as the maximum transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) of the transcripts mapped to the gene, where Biomart from Ensembl was used to map transcript IDs to gene symbols.
The expression value for a gene set from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was computed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis from the CCAL.
Differential gene and gene set expression analyses were performed using the CCAL.
Finally, this workflow from processing the sequenced reads stored as FASTQ files to performing the differential expression analyses is a shareable project.
